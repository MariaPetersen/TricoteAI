Beginning Knitting WHAT IS KNITTING?Hand knitting is to make fabric with yarn on two or more needles.A number of loops are first made on one needle, and then the fabric "grows'' by drawing other loops through them as they are passed back and forth along the needles from row to row.All knitting comes from two kinds of stitches.One is called a "knit stitch," and the other is called a "purl stitch." There are several different ways or methods of knitting.Refer to directions in the pattern/instructions for explanations and types of stitches required.Knitting can produce something useful, but the process can, and should be, fun and relaxing.The main thing is to learn to enjoy knitting—relax while you work, avoid a cramped position, have a good light to see by, and if your hands become tired, stop and rest a while.History of Knitting Knitting is older than written history.No one knows exactly when people began to knit, but we do know that as far back as A.D.
200, knitting was an advanced and accomplished art. The people of Scotland are believed to have been the first to knit with wool.A knitted fabric stretches more than a woven fabric, and it snaps back to its original size after it is stretched.For example, a woolen kn itted fabric can stretch as much as 30 percent and spring back to its original size.Long ago people found out how much better a knitted fabric was than a wo ven fabric for clothing that needs to stretch and then spring back to fit snugly.Sweaters, mittens, and stockings are examples of this kind of clothing.Knitting is probably more popular today than it has been at any other time in history.With the hundreds of different kinds and textures of yarns available, plus the constant development of new synthetic fibers and various combinations of them, there is no end to the beautiful and useful things you can learn to make.
KNITTING TOOLS  Knitting Needles The first tool that comes to mind when we think of knitting is needles. Knitting needles come in many sizes, types, and lengths and are made of different materials.Quality - Knitting needles undergo a variety of extra finishing steps to ensure a smooth surface without nicks or rough edges.Size - The size of a knitting needle refers to its diameter.In the United States, knitting needles are sized with numbers ranging from 0 to 50.Sizes 17 to 50 are considered "jumbo" or "jiffy" size needles.Canadian and European needle sizes are based on the metric system.Some U.S.needles are now labeled with both sizes.When you go shopping, look at the different sizes of needles that are available and compare the United States (standard) and metric measurements.CT-MMB.730 2 All knitting patterns tell you the size of needles you will need.Never discard your needles when you have fini shed the project.
If you lose one needle and have to buy another pair the same size, keep the extra needle. You never know when you may lose or break another one. Crochet Hook You will need a crochet hook to pick up dropped stitches and to correct other mistakes.They also come in many sizes.Size C, or 6, is a good one for 4-ply knitting yarn. Measuring Tool You will need a measuring tool.You can use a ruler, a measuring tape, or a metal measuring gauge.Be sure your measuring tool has both standard and metric measurements. Other helpful items: Scissors - You will also want to include in your knitting basket a pair of small scissors (kept in a case for safety).Yarn needle - a blunt-pointed yarn needle for sewing your articles together.Nail file or emery board - for catchy fingernails.A rough fingernail might catch on the yarn.Case for needles and hooks - You can make a handy case for knitting needles by cutting a piece of corrugated paper from a packing carton.
Stick your needles (and crochet hooks, too) in the ends of the paper. You can leave the holder flat for storage, or it can be rolled up and fastened with a rubber band.Small transparent case - It is a good idea to keep all easily lost items, such as rubber tips and tapestry needles, in a small transparent case.A long, round, narrow plastic medicine bottle will make a very nice case.Be sure to wash the bottle well before you use it for your needles and other small items.3 In addition to the equipment listed above, you may want to use the following:  Point protectors Little rubber tips that prevent the stitches from coming off the needle, protect the point of the needle from damage, and protect your hands and knitting containers from needle points. Markers—plastic rings Identifies a certain point in the knitting, such as an increase or a decrease. Stitch holder - a large "safety pin" that holds stitches temporarily. Cable stitch holder Holds reserve stitches out of the work area.
There are several types and sizes to choose from.  Knit counter A small, lightweight device that slips over the needle to keep count of the rows.Each type of counter has a dial arrangement with two sets of numbers that will record a count from 1 to 99. Stitch gauge Includes a 6-inch ruler and a useful measuring guide for determining the size of knitting needles.Many of the gauges available also have an open space for measuring stitches and rows.Of course, you will want something in which to keep your knitting and knitting tools.There are many things you might use for this purpose, so use your imagination!SELECTING PATTERNS AND YARN There are hundreds of sets of instructions for knitted articles.Some commercial companies provide excellent instructions, while others produce patterns with mistakes in their directions.The directions are often incomplete and hard to follow as well.
When selecting instructi ons for your project, remember that good inst ructions include: Clutter Control ♦ Pencil box/pouch to hold small equipment ♦ Cloth or sturdy bag w ith handles to tote supplies ♦ Pocket folder/binder to hold knitting patterns 4 1. A list of materials required—the kind and amount of yarn, size and number of needles, and other tools needed, such as a crochet hook.2.A gauge for the number of stitches per inch and number of rows per inch.3.Instructions that are printed clearly with print large enough to read easily.4.A clear photograph of the finished garment so that details can be seen, such as any pattern stitches, number of buttons and buttonholes, set-in sleeves or raglan sleeves, length of sleeves (full length or three-quarte r), total length of the garment on the m odel (waist length, high hip, or low hip), and the general shaping.5.Detailed instructi ons for finishing the garment.6.
A chart with the size range for the knitted garment in relation to body measurements so that you have a guide to the best size for you. When selecting a pattern for a knitted garment, read through the instructions before you buy.With a little experience in knitting, you will learn to recognize instructions that give enough details and are clear and easy to understand.Buy instructions and supplies with well-known brand names.About Yarns Many different kinds of yarns are available for knitting.Most yarn is wound in pull-out skeins.Read the Yarn Label The label or skein band should include the: • Manufacturer's name and address.• Type of yarn.• Fiber content.• Word "virgin," meani ng that the fiber is new and has not been reprocessed.• Number of plies.• Amount of yarn.• Color name and number.• Dye lot.• Certification mark (optional).• Care instructions.Types of Yarn Hundreds of different types and textures of yarn are available toda y.
Almost all knitting patterns tell you the kind and amount of yarn you will need to make an article. Hand knitting yarn of acrylic, wool, or wool/nylon is suitable for hats, mittens, gloves, sweaters, and scarves.Because of its firm twist and medium weight, 4-ply worsted hand knitting yarn is recommended for beginning knitters .When a knitted garment is designed, the yarn is an important part of the design.The thickness and texture of the yarn in relation to the pattern stitch are important.If you wish to substitute a yarn, choose one as similar as possible to the specified yarn.Be sure you can work to the gauge in the substitute yarn.Amount of Yarn Yarn is purchased by weight, not length.Since the weight of a skein varies, check the labels carefully to make sure there is enough yarn to complete the project.The pattern will tell you the number of ounces or grams of yarn needed for a knitting project.
Hints On Buying Good-Quality Yarn The quality of the yarn has a direct effect on the outcome of the finished product. Good- quality yarn means satisfactory and long-lasting results.To identify good-quality yarn, observe the color of the yarn.It should be even throughout the skein, since even a very slight variation in the color will be visible in the finished product. Dye lot-The dye lot number on the skein band is an identification number for the 5dye bath used for a quantity of yarn.Two skeins of yarn the same color but with different dye lot numbers can have a slight color variation that is only visible in the completed project.When you select the yarn you want, be sure to check each skein to make sure the color and dye lot numbers are the same. When you buy yarn, always buy enough yarn to make the completed project, since no two dye lots are exactly the same.It is better to have a little too much yarn than not enough. Twist of yarn - Ex amine the twist of the yarn.
It should be firmly twisted so that it will not separate easily during knitting. The yarn should be the same thickness throughout the skein to help ensure even stitches in the completed project.The yarn should be full and round in appearance so that the finished project will retain its shape. Resiliency of yarn - Check the resiliency of the yarn.Squeeze the skein.Good-quality yarn should bounce back.Twist or stretch a strand of yarn.When released, a good-quality yarn will spring back close to its original length.CARE OF KNITTING Save the skein band/label from the yarn used in the project in case there's a need to refer to the information on the label.Remember, the skein band also contains care instructions.Follow the information specified by the manufa cturer for the yarn.For best results do not allow a knitted item to become excessively soiled.Knitted garments should be stored folded flat, not hung on hangers.Good Knitting Habits 1.
Always remember to wash and dry your hands well before you pick up your knitting. If your hands become moist while knitting, rub a little talcum powder on them.This will keep the yarn from sticking to your fingers.2.Make sure you have good light when knitting.Poor lighting will not only strain your eyes but also will make it difficult to catch mistakes in your work.3.Check your posture.If you avoid a cramped position, you won't become tired so quickly.But when your hands become tired or you are tired, stop and rest!FOUR RULES TO LEARN BEFORE YOU START TO KNIT Rule 1.Learn knitting abbreviations.These abbreviations are the ABC's of the language of knitting.They are always used in exactly the same way in all directions.A list of commonly used abbreviations is included at the end of this publication.To begin with, you will need to know the following: k knit p purl st(s) stitch(es) sl slip stitch to other needle without knitting * repeat whatever follows * as indicated Rule 2.
Always read directions step by step. Never "read ahead" when you are following directions.Rule 3.Always try to finish the row before putting your work down.But, if you must put your work down in the middle of a row, be certain that the end of the yarn coming from the skein is in your right hand when you pick it up again.Then you can't go wrong.Rule 4.Know the two stitches used for all knitting.One is called a "knit" stitch (k); the other is called a "purl" stitch (p).Your directions will tell you when to "knit" and when to "purl." A good way to tell a "knit" from a "purl" is to think of the yarn on your needle as a neck, the "knit" stitch as a V- 6 neck sweater, and the "purl" stitch as a turtleneck sweater.CASTING ON-The First Step in Knitting Casting on (CO) is the technique for forming the first row of stitches on a knitting needle.This technique requires two yarn ends.There are several methods of casting on stitches.One method is shown here.
By using two yarns to cast on, the beginning or edge of your work will be stronger. For correct tension, as it is called, stitches should fit closely but not tightly around the needles.They should move back and forth along the needles freely but not so freely as to allow the needles to fall out.If you find that you have a tendency to cast on too tightly, use a larger size needle for the cast-on and bind-off rows.How to Begin 1.Measure a length of yarn long enough to complete the number of cast-on stitches specified in the knitting instructions.Allow 1 inch of yarn for every stitch you cast on and an additional 6 inches for finishing yarn ends.2.After measuring the yarn, make a slip knot for the first stitch.3.Place the loop on the needle and gently pull the ends of the ya rn (not too tightly).The skein of the yarn is to the right, and the free end of the yarn is to the left.What to Do with the Right Hand 1.
Hold the needle between the thumb and first finger, as if you were holding a pencil. 2.Be sure that the loop is near the pointed end of the needle.3.Using the skein end of the yarn, place the yarn loosely over the first finger, under the second, over the third, and under the fourth above the knuckles.The second and third fingers are very important because they keep the flow of yarn even, not too tight or too loose.That is, they regulate the tension.Knit or V-neck Purl or Turtleneck 7 What to Do with the Left Hand 1.Grasp the free end of the yarn lightly against the left hand with the second, third, and fourth fingers.2.Place the yarn near the needle around and under the thumb.Now You Are Ready to Work Bring the hands clos e together and adjust the yarn.Procedure 1.Notice that the yarn makes a loop around the left thumb.2.Insert your needle through the underside of the loop.3.Bring the yarn in the right hand over the point of the needle from the back.4.Draw it through the loop.5.
Slip the thumb out. Pull the yarn tightly.Two stitches are now on the needle.6.Repeat from Step 2 until you have the number of stitches needed.8 THE KNIT STITCH (k) Plain knitting or the garter stitch is characteristic of horizontal ridges and looks the same on the front as the back.What to Do with the Left Hand 1.In the left hand, hold the needle with the stitches you have just cast on.2.The first stitch is held lightly by the index finger near the tip of the needle.What to Do with the Right Hand 1.Hold the needle between the thumb and the index finger, as if you were holding a pencil.This is the same procedure as for casting on.2.The yarn is placed over the first finger, under the second, over the third and under the fourth above the knuckles.As you practice knitting, you will learn to adjust the yarn to get the best results.3.Bring your hands close together and adjust the yarn.Procedure-First Row 1.
Insert the right needle into the front of the first stitch on the left needle from the left side. Steady the right needle against the forefinger of the left hand.Keep your yarn to the back of your work.2.With the right hand, bring the yarn over the point of the right needle.3.Draw the yarn through the stitch.4.Slip the old stitch off the left needle, thus completing the first new stitch.A new row is being formed on the right needle.95.Always keep pushing your work up so that the stitch on wh ich you are working is near the tip of the needle.6.Repeat Steps 1 th rough 4 until all the stitches have been knitted off the left needle.An easy way to remember these steps is to repeat to yourself: "in" (Step 1); "over" (Step 2); "through" (Step 3); "off" (Step 4).Second Row & Succeeding Rows 1.Change the needle with the stitches into the left hand.2.The empty needle is in the right hand.
The yarn is over the first finger, under the second, over the third, and under the fourth above the knuckles. 3.Slip the first stitch off the left needle onto the right needle without knitting.To do this, insert right needle into loop from the right side, transfer loop to right needle.Do this with the first stitch of each row and you will have a smooth edge.4.Bring your yarn to the back of your work by passing it between the two needles.5.Proceed as before.Watch your work closely to be sure that you have not dropped a stitch.When every row is knit the fabric that results is known as the garter stitch .THE PURL STITCH (p) The purl stitch differs in two ways from the knit stitch.In plain kni tting, the yarn is at the back of your work.In purling, the yarn is to the front of your work.In plain knitting, the needle is inserted in the front of the stitch from the left side of the other needle.In purling, insert the needle in the front of the stitch from the right side of the other needle.
The purl stitch is not used alone; it is combined with the knit stitch to create different patterns. When the pattern is knit one row and purl the next, the result is a fabric that is smooth on one side.We call this the stockinette stitch .Sometimes the purl side is used for the outside of the article.This is called reversed stockinette stitch .10THE RIB STITCH The rib stitch/ribbing is made by alternating a number of knit stitc hes with purl stitches.The most common form of ribbing is knit two, purl two.In knit -two, purl-two ribbing, the number of stitches cast on is usually divisible by four.Knit the first two stitches, bring the yarn forward and purl two stitches, then bring the yarn to the back and knit two stitches.Continue in this m anner to the end of the row.Always bring the yarn between the needles.Do not go over the top of a needle, as this will make a hole in the row of stitches.
When you turn your work for the next row, the stitches that are purled on the previous row will become knit stitches on the following row. Remember that an easy way to tell a knit stitch fr om a purl stitch is to think of the knit stitch as a "V-neck" sweater.When binding off in ribbing, always remember to bind off by knitting the knit stitches and purling the purl stitches as if you were continuing to rib.Because of its elasticity, ribbing is frequently used on the part of the garment that fits snugly, such as the waistband and cuffs of a sweater and the tops of mittens and socks.Ribbing is usually worked on smaller size needles than the rest of the garment.BINDING OFF (BO) When a knitting project is finished, the final technique is called binding off.Procedure 1.Slip the first stitch on the row off the left needle onto the right needle without knitting.2.Knit the next stitch very loosely.There are now two stitches on the right needle.3.
Insert the left needle through the left side of the first stitch. 4.Keep the yarn in the right hand very loose so that the second stitch remains loose.5.Bring the first stitch forward over the second stitch and over the tip of the needle so that one stitch remains on the needle.6.Repeat Steps 2 through 5 to bind off the remaining stitches.7.When you come to the last stitch, clip your yarn about 3 inches from the needle.Bring the loose end through the stitch remaining on the needle and pull tightly.Darn or weave in the loose end so that it will not show.11 If the project is going to require that a seam be sewn along the bound-off edge, you may wish to leave the yarn long enough to sew the seam.GAUGE Gauge refers to the number of stitches to the inch and the number of rows to the inch.The correct gauge is essential to knitting a garment of the right size and fit.Gauge is determined by the size of the needles, the type of yarn, and the tension and rhythm of the individual.
Tension and rhythm are developed through practice and will vary from person to person. Tension is the "pull" on the yarn as it passes through the fingers.Tension controls the tightness or looseness of the knitting.An even tension is achieved by passing yarn through relaxed fingers.The stitches should be loose enough so that the needle passes through easily but tight enough so that the stitches don't fall off the needle.Rhythm is the flow of one hand knitting movement to the next.With practice, rhythm will become steady and smooth.Check the Gauge Knitting instructions will specify the gauge.The gauge should always be checked by making a sample square using the same yarn and needle size given in the instructions.Cast on 20 stitches and knit for 3 inches (7.6 cm) or more in the same stitch used for the major portion of the project.Measuring the Gauge Bind off the stitches on the sample and place the sample on a flat surface.
With a ruler, measure across the sample, counting rows to the inch. The above figure shows how to measure the garter stitch.The gauge is 4 stitches = 1 inch (2.5 cm) and 9 rows = 1 inch (2.5 cm).The figure below shows how to measure the stockinette stitch.The gauge is 5 stitches = 1 inch (2.5 cm) or 10 stitches = 2 inches and 6 rows = 1 inch (2.5 cm).By using a 2-inch measure, you allow for variation.If one inch has fewer stitches than the directions called for, you need to use a smaller needle.If it has more stitches, you need to use a larger needle.The needle sizes given in the knitting instructions are only suggested sizes.Use any size needle that will produce the correct gauge.Experiment with needle si zes until the exact gauge is achieved.In testing gauge, don't unravel previous samples and reuse the 12yarn.Knitting with used yarn can affect the gauge.SELVAGE The selvage is the edge of your knitting.
To make a neater edge and one that is easier to seam, slip the first stitch of each row instead of knitting or purling the stitch. SEWING SEAMS When you finish knitting a garment, it is a big temptation to sew up the seams as quickly as possible.Don't be tempted!Seams are a very import ant part of a knitted garment, and good seams take time, care, and patience.There are several kinds of seams.Sometimes it is best to use one seam, and at other times it is best to use another.The important thing is to use the seam that looks best and is most suitable for the article.Be sure your finished seam has as much elasticity, or stretch, as your knitted fabric, whichever type of seam you choose to use.Flat Overcast Seam 1.If you look carefully at the side of a knitted fabric, you will see that the end stitches of your f abric have 2 threads forming a top and bottom edge (if you have slipped the first st itch of each row).2.
Place the 2 pieces to be sewn side by side with edges even and wrong side up. 3.If you have a yarn on either piece of your garment long enough to sew your seam with, use it to sew your seam.Otherwise, thread a piece of the same yarn you used in knitting your garment into your yarn needle and attach the yarn with a single knot to the wrong side of the piece on the right.Leave about 2 inches of yarn on the end of the knot.Do not cut the yarn close to the knot, as the knot may come untied.4.Now insert your needle into the top half of the first stitch on the right and then into the top half of the first stitch on the left and pull the yarn through the two stitches firmly.5.Next insert your needle into the top half of the second stitch on the right and the top half of the second stitch on the left.Put the fingers of your left hand under your work and put your thumb on the outside of the first stitch you made.
Hold the first stitch tightly with your thumb and fingers as you pull the thread for your second stitch firmly. Continue in this manner, sewing through the top half of every stitch, until you have finished your seam.Be very careful to hold the last stitch completed with the thumb and fingers of your left hand while you pull the yarn to tighten the stitch you are working on.In 13 this way your seam will be firm but still have elasticity.If you fail to hold each stitch in this manner each time you pull a new stitch, your yarn will pull too tightly the full length of your seam, and the seam will be too tight.6.Check your work every few inches to make sure that it is flat and even on the right side and that your seam has enough "stretch." If you find that the two edges are not coming out even (in other words, if one side has a few more stitches than the other), skip a stitch now and then on the longer side to make them come out even at the end of your seam.7.
When your seam is completed, it should be flat and even with almost as much stretch or elasticity as your knitted fabric. Backstitch Seam 1.Pin, and then baste the pieces to be joined together with edges even and right sides together with the wrong sides out.2.Thread a yarn needle with the same yarn used in the knitting.If using 4-ply yarn, you can "split it" and use only 2-ply for the seam.(If you have a length of yarn left on either piece long enough for your seam, use it.) 3.Sew the seam with a backstitch about 1/4-inch from the edge 4.To make a backstitch, bring the needle out on the right side, insert it back to the end of the last stitch, then from the wrong side bring the needle out on the right side in front of the yarn.Repeat until you have the desired length of seam.5.Do not pull the stit ches too tightly, as your finished seam should have elasticity.6.It is wise to check the right side of your work from time to time to ensure neatness.7.Steam seams open and flat.
FINISHING YARN ENDS After the knitted article is completed, finish all yarn ends by weaving the yarn into the seam. If there is no seam, separate the strand of yarn into two sections before weaving the yarn.To weave in the yarn, thread it into a tapestry needle.Weave the yarn into the wrong side of the knitting for about 2 inches.For yarn separated into sections, weave the sections in opposite directions.The woven-in yarn should not be visible from the right side.14 INCREASING Increasing is the technique of adding stitches so that the project becomes wider.There are many ways to increase in knitting.The increase stitch most commonly used is to knit into the front and then into the back of the same stitch before removing it from the needle.
Knitting instructions may refer to this as "k in front and back of st." This method of increasing is used at the edge of a garment for shaping and at places where the increase itself forms part of the design of a garment, such as in raglan sleeve seams. How to Increase in Knitting 1.When you wish to increase the number of stitches in the ro w, knit one stitch but do not slip this stitch off the left needle.2.Move the right-hand needle behind the left-hand needle.Insert the needle in back of the same stitch and knit another stitch.3.Slip the stitch off the left-hand needle.There will be two stitches transferred to the right-hand needle instead of one.Yarn Over Yarn over (yo) is another method of increasing.It is also used to make an eyelet and to help form many pattern stitches.To yarn over before a kn it stitch, bring your yarn to the front of the right-hand needle and knit the next stitch.Thus, a loop is formed on the right needle and an extra stitch is added.
To yarn over before a purl stitch, wrap the yarn completely around the right-hand needle and purl the next stitch in the usual manner. Thus, a loop is formed on the right-hand needle and an extra stitch is added.DECREASING Decreasing is the technique for reducing the number of stitches so that the project becomes narrower.To decrease means to take away from the number of stitches you are working with.Th e decrease, like the increase, is used to shape your work or to help form a design in your knitted garment.15 How to Decrease When Knitting On a knit row, knit tw o stitches together (k 2 tog).This method produces a stitch decreasing that slant s to the right when seen on the right side of a project.How to Decrease When Purling On a purl row, purl two stitches together (p 2 tog).Decreasing by slip one, knit one, pass slip stitch over (psso): Slip one stitch (from the left-hand to the right-hand needle without knitting—sl 1—as in the figure below).Then, knit one stitch (k 1).
This method makes the resulting decreased stitch slant to the left. With the left-hand needle, pass the slipped stitch over the knitted stitch (psso).JOINING YARN Joining yarn is the technique of attaching a new skein of yarn to the yarn already in use.Joining yarn is also used to create stripes in knitted articles.For best results, always join the new yarn at the beginning of a row.A yarn that has been joined in the middle of a row may be visible from the right side of the project.To join yarn at the beginning of a row, tie the new yarn to the old one using a single knot.Tighten the knot and move it up close to the work.Continue knitting, using the new yarn.The knot can shift causing the first few stitches to have a loos e tension.Therefore, readjust the knot and tighten those stitches before completing the row.After you have knitted a few rows you can go back and weave the tail ends into the back of your knitting.
When your design calls for color changes, the directions will identify whether you are working with a main color (MC) or a contrasting color (CC) . You may have more than one contrasting color, in which each will be identified separately.Splicing Yarns This method may be used on a 4-ply yarn.You may splice other yarns, but not by splitting.You may join yarn by splicing anywhere in your work.If splicing is done carefully and properly, it is almost impossible to detect Figure HH 16the join.To splice yarn, unravel the end of both pieces of yarn (the old and the new) for about 4 inches.Separate the threads and cut two of the 4 plies off about 3 inches from the end Dampen the tips of all 8 strands.Lay the strands of both pieces of yarn together; dovetail or roll them all together following the original twist of the yarn as much as possible.
PATTERN STITCHES Once you have advanced to the point where your knitting tension is even, and you can do most of the basic knitting steps with skill and ease, you are ready to add distinction and individuality to your work with pattern stitches. Regardless of how intricate some pattern stitches appear to be, they are all made with a combination of the basic knitting stitches and steps that you have already learned.(Ribbing used in the body of a garment is considered a pattern stitch.Ribbing used to finish the edges of a garment is not considered a pattern stitch.) In reading the directions for a garment made with a pattern stitch, you will more than likely find the term “multiple of stitches.” This means that to have the pattern work out correctly, the number of stitches cast on must be divisible by the multiple given.For instance, multiple of 5 sts would be any number divisible by 5, e.g., 25.
If the multiple is 5 sts plus 1, the number of stitches cast on must be divisible by 5 and 1 stitch over, or 26. When you have selected your pattern, make a fairly large swatch, working in the pattern stitch by casting on the multiple of stitches called for in the pattern.This will not only allow you to become thoroughly acquainted with the appearance of the pattern, but it will also give you the opportunity of working the pattern so you will be at ease and your tension will be more even.Directions are included here for just a few of the many pattern stitches.Seed Stitch (also known as the moss or rice stitch)—  Cast on an uneven number of stitches. Row 1—*K 1 st, p 1 st.Repeat from * across the row, ending with k 1. Repeat this row.In making this stitch, be sure to k the purl sts and p the knit stitches on the following row.Basket Stitch (also know as block stitch)—  Cast on a number of stitches divisible by 10 (multiple of 10). Row 1—*K 5, p 5.
Repeat from * across the row, ending with p 5.  Repeat this row 4 more times. Row 6—*P 5, k 5.Repeat from * across the row, ending with k 5. Repeat this row 4 more times. Repeat these 10 rows for the pattern stitch.17Diamond Stitch —  Cast on a multiple of 8 sts, plus 1 st. Row 1—K 4, *p 1, k 7.Repeat from * across the row, ending with p 1, k 4. Row 2—P 3, *k 1, p 1, k 1, p 5.Repeat from * across the ro w, ending with p 3. Row 3—K 2, *p 1, k 3.Repeat from * across the row, ending with k 2. Row 4—*P 1, k 1, p 5, k 1.Repeat from * across the row, ending with p 1. Row 5—*P 1, k 7.Repeat from * across the row, ending with p 1. Row 6—Same as Row 4. Row 7—Same as Row 3. Row 8—Same as Row 2. Repeat these 8 rows for the pattern stitch.Cable Stitch —  Multiple of 10 sts plus 2 sts. Row 1—P 3, *k 6, p 4.Repeat from * across the row, ending with k 6, p 3. Row 2—K 3, p 6, *k 4, p 6.Repeat from * across the row, ending with k 3. Repeat rows 1 and 2 twice (6 rows in all).
 Row 7—P 3, *slip next 3 sts on a double-point needle a nd place in back of work. K next 3 sts, then k the 3 sts from a double-point needle (forms cable).P4.Repeat from * acro ss the row, ending with a cable and p 3. Row 8—Repeat Row 2. Repeat these 8 rows for the pattern stitch.This is a 6-stitch simple cable stitch.There are several variations of the cable stitch, such as the plaited cable, lattice cable, mock cable, etc.“Holes” Before Cables In most cable patterns you will find a series of purl stitches before and after the cable.Sometimes when working a cable stitch, a “hole” or loose stitch will appear before or after the cable.To prevent, pull yarn tighter than usual when bringing the yarn back to the front of the work to purl.Sometimes this same flaw will occur when working ribbing, and may be corrected in the same way.BLOCKING For best results, always read the yarn or thread label and follow the manufacturer's blocking and care recommendations .
The method you use to block your project is determined by the fiber content of the yarns or threads. For Synthetics and Blended Yarns Follow the instructions on the yarn label.As a general rule, individual pieces can be blocked by covering with a damp cloth such as a dish towel for several minutes (5 to 10 minutes).Cloth should be thoroughly wet with excess dripping wa ter removed before placing on knitted piece.When blocking two pieces which are exactly the same shape, place damp cloth between pieces.NEVER 18 press synthetics or blends since pressing destroys the loft of the yarn.For Cotton Yarn Preheat the iron at the wool setting.Cover the pieces with a damp cloth and steam.The weight of the ir on should not rest on the piece of knitting.For Wool Yarns Preheat the iron at the wool setting.Cover the pieces with a damp cloth and steam.Never rest the full we ight of the iron on knitting done in wool yarn.Here are some general procedures to follow when blocking worsted wool yarn: 1.
Prepare a blocking surface by covering a flat surface such as a table or ironing board with several layers of towels. 2.Then, place the project piece wrong side up on the blocking surface.Pin the edges to the proper shape and measurements given in the directions; use rust-proof T-pins, about ¼ inch apart.If blocking surface would be harmed by pin holes, insert the pins into the towels at an angle.Note: If your project is made in separate pieces, such as a back and a front, the two identic al pieces should be blocked at the same time.3.Place a damp cloth over the pieces already pinned; t hen steam with a hot iron held just barely above the damp cloth.4.Leave the project pinned until thoroughly dry.5.Remove the pins and sew up the seams by the desired method.6.Steam seams on the wrong side.Wool items, whether they are fabric or yarn, require the use of moisture when pressing.This could be in the form of steam iron and/ or a damp press cloth.
For any blocking procedure that uses a damp cloth or steam, always allow the pieces to dry completely before lifting. Do not block the ribbing portion of a piece, as this will destroy the elasticity (ability to stretch).ORNAMENTATION Pom-poms Cut two rounded discs the desired size (2½-inches in diameter for a medium size pom-pom, larger for a larger pom-pom) and then cut a ¼- to ½-inch hole in center.Cardboard or plastic tops from margarine tubs are good materials to use for the discs.Thread a yarn needle with two strands of yarn and cover the discs.After the discs are entirely covered, slip scissors between them and cut all threads at the outside edge.Wind a thread several times between the discs, leaving the ends long enough to join pompom and article.Remove cardboard and trim.To make your pompom very fuzzy, place the finished pompom on the 19 end of a table fork and hold it over a steam kettle; keep turning the pompom slowly until it is moist and fuzzy.
Be very careful not to burn yourself! Pom-poms give a nice finished touch to the top of a cap or house slippers.Tassels For tassels, use scrap yarn and a rectangular piece of cardboard that is 3-inches long or the desired length of your tassel.Cut two lengths of yarn 10-inches long and put them aside.Wind remaining yarn around the cardboard.Slip the two 10-inch lengths of yarn under the strands at one end of the cardboard and tie it securely.Cut the strands at the opposite end.With another length of yarn, wrap the bundle about 1/2-inch down from the top where you first tied the bundle together, fasten securely.Trim the ends of your tassel evenly.Tassels can be used instead of fringe on the edge of a scarf, the end of a stocking cap, or the corners of pillows.Fringe Cut strands of yarn double the desired length.Hold 4 strands together and fold them in half to form a loop.Working along the narrow edge, and insert a crochet hook from back to front into the first stitch.
Draw a loop through the stitch. Draw the loose ends through the loop and pull them tightly to form a knot.Add fringe to every other stitch across the row, beginning with the first stitch and ending with the last stit ch.Trim the fringe evenly.Use fringe to finish the ends of scarves, afghans, and ponchos.Twisted Cord Measure yarn approximately three times the desired finished length of cord.You should determine how many strands of yarn to use for particular thickness (to experiment, you might want to try four).With two people facing each other, each person knots the end to a pencil and twists the pencil clockwise until the yarn is taut.When the yarn begins to kink, one person holds both pencils, while the other holds the center of the cord and lets the yarn twist.20 Knot the ends to prevent unraveling.Cut folded end to allow yarn to form tassels; trim ends to match.Twisted cord may be used as a handle for knitted purse.
