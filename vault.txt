It is important to read the explanations and follow the steps in the order given To ensure your first steps into the world of knitting are a complete success, it is critical not to set the bar too high!Get started on a "beginner" pattern easy to follow as well as quick to make (scarves, accessories, baby designs…).I CHOOSE THE RIGHT PATTERN When starting a ball, it is better to take the yarn from the inside of the ball and not the outside.By doing this the ball will not unwind or form knots.If you take your yarn from the inside it will unravel easier and your knitting will be quicker.I GET OUT THE BALL OF YARNI PICK UP MY NEEDLES, 1, 2, 3… I’M OFF !TIPS AND HINTS FOR KNITTERS Aaaaaaagh !!!I can’t take it anymore !!!
Where is the end of this ball ??? 7Always change at the beginning of a row.At the end of the last row cut your yarn leaving a 10 cm strand.Start the next ball of yarn leaving a 10 cm strand at the beginning before your 1st stitch.I CHANGE TO A NEW BALL OF YARNTry knitting flexibly and smoothly, don’t pull the yarn or your stitches will be very tight and difficult to knit.To obtain an even tension, Make small squares, dolls clothes, accessories.Practice until it becomes natural and easy to do, then move on to mittens, scarves and more.Feel free to use novelty yarns so that small imperfections go unnoticed.Always finish the row before putting down your knitting, as your stitches can stretch and a gap can form if knitting is left in the middle of a row.Don’t hesitate to count stitches as you work, you will know sooner if you have dropped a stitch or created a new stitch in error.
You will then have less work to undo if you have to go back.IMPORTANT 8I MAKE A TENSION SQUAREMost patterns need a tension square. Before you start working on a pattern, make sure that the end-result will be perfect by making a swatch.You’ve got to make sure that your knitting tension is exactly the same as the tension in our pattern.If it isn’t, your garment is likely to be too big or too small.CHECK YOUR TENSION HOW TO MAKE A SWATCH ?Using the yarn, needles, and stitch specified for the pattern, work a square at least 6 in (15 cm) on a side.Iron the square lightly on the wrong side under a damp cloth or using a steam iron.If the swatch is worked in ribbing, stretch it slightly.With a ruler, count the sts to equal 4 in (10 cm) widthways and 4 in (10 cm) lengthways.Compare the result with the sample given in our instructions.Your tension square matches ours !You can start your knitting, you can be sure your project will have the same dimensions as the grid.
Your sample has more stitches and rows ?Your knitting is too tight. Make another swatch with needles one size larger.Your sample has fewer stitches and rows ?Your knitting is too loose.Make another swatch with needles one size smaller.When your swatch matches ours, you’re ready to follow the instructions.You can expect to end up with a garment that’s just right.15 cm 15 cm BEWARE: It is important to achieve an exact number of stitches for the design to fit correctly.However, the number of rows can be adapted depending on the height indicated in cm.9I CAST ON THE STITCHESCasting on is the start of the knitting.Seeing it live is even easier !Find our video tutorials on www.youtube.com/bergerefr Form a knot around the needle about a yard (metre) from the end of the yarn and slip it under the needle.Gently pull the yarn end.Hold the needle in your right hand, with the yarn running from the ball over your index finger.
1 Using the right index finger, pass the yarn from the ball over the tip of the needle and hold it next to the needle with your right hand. 4Wind the free end of the yarn around your left thumb, holding it in place with your ring finger and little finger.Hold the yarn coming from the ball with your right hand.2 Pass the loop in front of the tip and, when the loop is under the needle, withdraw you thumb.5Tuck the needle under your arm to hold it steady.Insert the tip of the needle under the first strand of yarn over your thumb.3 Gently pull on the yarn end with your left hand, using the your right hand to steady the stitch thus formed.Repeat from step 2 until you have formed the required number of stitches.6 10I LEARN THE BASICSKnitting is composed of stitches, the stitches form rows.The sequence of stitches and rows create pattern names (garter stitch, stocking st...).1 stitch 1 row Hold the needle with the cast-on stitches in your left hand with the yarn at the back of the work.
Insert the right-hand needle from left to right in the first stitch, passing under the left-hand needle. Wind the yarn around the right-hand needle passing under and over the tip and hold the yarn against the right-hand needle with your right hand..Insert the tip of the right- hand needle into the stitch on the left-hand needle and again over the left- hand needle.The loop thus formed on the right-hand needle is a knit stitch.Let the loop drop off the left-hand needle and keep the new stitch on the right- hand needle.To knit a row, repeat steps 1 to 4 until all the stitches have passed from the left to the right-hand needle.Hold the needle with the cast-on stitches in your left hand with the yarn in front of the work.Insert the right-hand needle from right to left in the first stitch on the left-hand needle.Turn the work, take the needle with the stitches in your left hand, and work the next row.
Turn the work, take the needle with the stitches in your left hand, and work the next row.To purl a row, repeat steps 1 to 4 until all the stitches have passed from the left to the right-hand needle. Let the loop drop off the left-hand needle and keep the new stitch on the right- hand needle.Insert the tip of the right- hand needle into the stitch on the left-hand needle and again under the left- hand needle.The loop thus formed on the right-hand needle is a purl stitch.Wind the yarn around the right-hand needle passing over and under the tip and hold the yarn against the right-hand needle with your right hand.KNIT PURL 11I DISCOVER THE BASIC STITCHES Seeing it live is even easier !Find our video tutorials on www.youtube.com/bergerefr Sorry ?What was that darling ?A restaurant ?Tonight ?Thanks, but I already have a date !When you knit every row, the resulting pattern is called garter stitch.Row 1 (right side) : knit.Row 2 (wrong side) : purl.

Bring the yarn in front of the work then over the right-hand needle. Work the next stitch on the left- hand needle.The yarn forward loop forms an extra stitch with a hold at its base on the right-hand needle.Next row : When you come to the yarn forward loop, purl it as you would any other stitch; you now have 1 extra stitch.15 Two needles...one ball of wool...zero hang-ups.STICHES TIPS HINTSTechnical NOTES 16 This method of decreasing is always used for Raglan sleeves.It forms a line of slanting stitches parallel with the seam.The decrease is worked with the right side facing, one or more stitches from the edge.The example shows decreases 1 stitch from the edge : At beginning of row, with right side facing, knit 1, slip 1, knit 1, pass slipped stitch over (See above).Continue the row as indicated.
When 3 sts are left on the left-hand needle, knit the next 2 sts together (see knit 2 together, page 7), knit the last stitch.Single decrease Slip a stitch on to the right-hand needle as if to knit.Knit the next stitch. Using the left-hand needle, pass the slipped stitch over the stitch you just worked.After working a single decrease, you have 1 less stitch on the needle.Double decrease Slip a stitch on to the right-hand needle as if to knit.Knit the next 2 stitches together.Using the left-hand needle, pass the slipped stitch over the 2 stitches you just worked.After working a double decrease, you have 2 fewer stitches on the needle.Double decrease slip slip knit Slip 2 stitches as if to knit.Knit 1.Pass the 2 slipped stitches over the stitch just worked..Twisted knit stitch Knit the stitch, inserting the needle through the back loop to twist the new stitch.
Twisted purl stitch Purl the stitch, inserting the needle under the back lops to twist the new stitch.Raglan decreases Nonstitch or suppressed stitch Sometimes, the number of stitches varies from row to row in a pattern; the nonstitches or suppressed stitches are represented by black squares on the chart. When you follow the chart, do not try to work the black squares but go directly to the next square.Working in reverse When instructed on the front of a garment, for example a jacket, to work the other front in reverse.If you increased or decreased at the beginning of a right side row on the first front you must increase or decrease at the end of the right side row on the second front at the same measurement.The positions of the stitches used will also be reversed, if you ended with a ribbed section for a border on the first front you will start with the ribbed section on the second front.
However the pattern should remain the same (do not reverse a cable twist for example).Put the right needle through the 2nd then the 1st stitch on the left hand needle. Knit the 2 stitches together (wrap yarn around right hand needle and pull through the 2 stitches on the left needle).By knitting 2 stitches together you will have 1 less stitch on the needle..Knit 2 together 17 Increases of one stitch or more at end of work Increases 1 stitch in from edge of rowWhen you need to increase a stitch in a row you will need to work twice into one stitch.Put your right needle through the loop of the stitch below the current stitch on your left needle, knit into this stitch.Work the stitch on your left needle as normal.You will have one more stitch.These increases are always done on the right side of work, 1 stitch in from the edge.Wrap yarn around the needle at the beginning of the row as many times as you need stitches.
If you are increasing at each end you will also need to do at the end of the row. Work these stitches as knit or purl in the pattern required.At the beginning of the row, on the right side of work, knit 1 stitch, put the right needle under the horizontal thread before the first stitch on left needle.Put this strand onto the left needle.Knit into the back of this loop to twist it.This prevents a gap forming at the bottom of the increased stitch.Continue along the row.At the end of the row, on the right side of work, work until 1 stitch remains on left needle, pass right needle through the back of the horizontal thread between stitches and place on left needle.Knit this stitch as normal then knit last stitch.direction of work Stretch cast-on Short Row Shaping Short rows are rows which are not worked in their entirety, this gives a curve to the work as more rows are completed on one side than the other.
They can be used on just one side of work or both sides, creating a gentle slope instead of the stepped edge created by casting off a series of stitches. When told to turn the work during the progress of a row you will not work the remaining stitches on the left hand needle.To avoid creating a hole when you turn the work, after turning, with the yarn at the front of work (as if about to purl), slip the 1st stitch on the left hand needle onto the right hand needle as if to purl, then take yarn back to back of work (called a wrap) & work the remaining stitches as normal.When you have finished the short row shaping and need to knit across the whole row you need to knit together the wrap & the next stitch.Take the wrapped stitch back over the top of next stitch then knit both together.Stretch cast-on Take a ball of yarn in a contrasting colour and cast on half the required number of stitches plus 1 extra.
For example : If the pattern tells you to cast on 45 stitches, using the contrasting yarn cast on 45 + 1 = 23 stitches. 2Now, using the yarn you intend to work the pattern with, work as follows :Row 1 : * knit 1, bring yarn forward under the needle, yarn over *.Repeat from * to *.End with knit 1.Row 2 : Slip the first stitch as if to purl on to the right-hand needle, *pass yarn to back, knit 1 (= yarn forward loop from previous row), bring yarn forward, slip next stitch as if to purl *.Repeat from * to *.Row 3 : * knit 1, yarn forward, slip 1 stitch as if to purl, pass yarn to back *.Repeat from * to *.End with knit 1.Continue working in 1/1 rib, beginning Row 1 with purl 1.After completing the ribbing, pull out the contrasting yarn.Increases within a row With the yarn at the back of the work, insert the right-hand needle into the next stitch from right to left, as if to purl.Slip the stitch on to the right-hand needle and continue working as given.
Next row : Purl the slipped stitch.Slipped stitch 18Pattern stitches Instructions for pattern stitches are always given row by row, as well as in chart form, with each square on the chart representing 1 stitch and 1 row. The accompanying legend explains the terms and matches the symbols to the stitches.The chart shows the right side of the work, it is not always possible, however, to include all the subtleties of a pattern stitch in a chart.For that reason, we advise you to always read the row-by-row instructions, even if you prefer to use a chart.Knit over knit and purl over purl is an instruction often used for ribbing and pattern stitches.1) To form armholes or collar You must cast off stitches at the beginning of rows:Casting oﬀ stitches On the right side of work, slip 1 stitch onto the right needle as if to purl.Knit the following stitch.Using the left needle pass the slipped stitch over the top of the 2nd stitch on the right hand needle.You have cast off 1 stitch.
Knit the next stitch and pass stitch on right needle over the top, you have cast off a 2nd stitch. Repeat this step for the required number of stitches.On the following row, on the wrong side of work, cast off in the same way but work the stitches as purl stitches.On the following row, cast off the next number of stitches indicated in the pattern to obtain a sloped edge.knitted stitch 2) When work is complete, to cast off all stitches.Start to cast off as for casting off at the beginning of row:Slip the 1st stitch, knit the following stitch.With the left needle, pass the slipped stitch over the top of the knitted stitch.Knit the next stitch and with the left needle, pass the 1st stitch on needle over the top of the current stitch.One stitch remains on right needle.Repeat this sequence until all stitches from the left needle have been worked and only one stitch remains on right needle.
Cut thread 10 cm from work and pull through remaining stitch using needle.Yarn over needle, then knit 2 together.On the next row work the yarn over needle as normal.For a small buttonhole, one stitch is sufficient to make a buttonhole: Small buttonholes Buttonholes 1st row : Work to where the buttonhole should be, cast off the number of sts indicated in the pattern and work to end of row. 2nd row : Work to cast off sts, cast on the same number of sts as 1st row and work to end of row.No-cut buttonholes Using a sewing needle, pick up the horizontal strand of the stitch where you want to place the buttonhole, pull it up and attach it 2 rows higher with a few little stitches on the wrong side of the work.Repeat with thehorizontal strand below the first strand, and attach it in the same way 2 rows down.19 This technique is widely used in European patterns, but is not so popular among UK and US knitters.
When you have completed the sections, do not cast off, but leave the stitches on a spare needle.Thread a tapestry needle with the matching yarn. Work with right side facing.Place the 2 spare needles together.
Insert the tapestry needle through the centre of the first stitch on the front needle as if to purl (leave the stitch on the needle),– and bring the tapestry needle out at the centre of the first stitch on the back needle as if to knit (leave the stitch on the needle),*bring the tapestry needle through the center of the first stitch on the front needle again as if to knit and slip off the stitch,– Insert the tapestry needle through the centre of the next stitch on the front needle as if to purl (leave the stitch on the needle),– bring the tapestry needle out at the center of the next (first) stitch on the back needle again as if to purl and slip off the stitch,– Insert the tapestry needle through the centre of the next stitch on the back needle as if to knit (leave the stitch on the needle)*, maintaining an even tension. Repeat the movement until the seam is complete.
Work all the free stitches into the seam one by one and let the stitches drop off the spare needles as they are grafted together.The finished seam will look identical to a row of knitting.Grafting When the different sections of the garment are completed, you may need to pick up stitches at the edge of your work, for example on the collar or front borders To pick up the stitches knit wise, put needle through the middle of each stitch on the last row and pick up the loop.When you are picking up stitches on rows where there are more rows than stitches required work through 2 or 3 rows then skip 1 row to obtain the number of stitches required in the pattern. for example on the collar or front borders Picking up stitchesCables It is easy to work narrow cables over 2 stitches : Right cross 2 (2CR) : Passing in front of the work, knit the 2nd st on the left-hand needle then knit the first stitch; slip both stitches on to the right-hand needle at once.
Left cross 2 (2CL) : Passing behind the work, knit the 2nd st on the left-hand needle then knit the first stitch as usual; slip both stitches on to the right-hand needle at once. A cable made up of 3 or more stitches requires the use of a cable needle.Cable 4 left (front) : Slip 2 stitches on to a cable needle in front of work, knit 2, then slip the 2 stitches from the cable needle on to the left-hand needle and knit 2.Cable 4 right (back) : Slip 2 stitches on to a cable needle at back of work, knit 2, then slip the 2 stitches from the cable needle on to the left-hand needle and knit 2.Place the 2 pieces right sides together.Thread a tapestry needle with the matching yarn, insert the needle through both thicknesses, matching stitch for stitch, and bring the needle out 2 rows further along.
Following the sketch, working with the 2 pieces to be joined, pick up the horizontal thread between the first and second stitches and pull firmly to bring the edges together and make the join invisible. If the edge is very uneven, work the thread between the second and third stitches.Backstitched seamInvisible seam You may also use an invisible seam to join at the shoulder.In that case, pick up the 2 upright strands of a stitch 1 row in from the edge.20Fair Isle Fair Isle and contrasting colour patterns.These patterns are worked in stocking stitch using several colours to make a design shown on a chart.] Each square on the chart represents 1 stitch and 1 row.A legend accompanying the chart indicates the colours.Read the chart beginning at the bottom row, from right to left for the right side of the work, and from left to right for the wrong side rows.KNITTED PATTERNS Various techniques are used according to the complexity of the pattern.
- When the motifs of the design are small and close together, you may let the yarn not in use run loosely at the back of the work. Make sure that you don’t pull the yarn taut or it will pucker the pattern.- When the motifs are far apart or very wide, pass the yarn not in use behind the work attaching it along with the one that is in use : hold the yarn not in use in your left hand, then work a stitch passing the right-hand needle under that yarn but taking care not to actually knit the yarn.Repeat this movement every other stitch.- When the motifs are very large or use several colours, do no try to pass the yarn at the back of the work.Instead, use several balls of each colour, as needed, using the intarsia technique.Each time you change yarn colour, make sure that you twist the yarns loosely at the back of the work to avoid forming holes in the texture.In all three cases, take care to work evenly, especially where the colours change and stitches tend to be loose.
EMBROIDERED PATTERNS Embroidery can be used to advantage instead of knitted patterns when the motifs are made up of relatively few stitches. This technique avoids the problems of disposing of extra yarns at the back of the work.For embroidery, form open chain stitch with a tapestry needle, working from right to left.Bring the needle from wrong side to right side at the base of the first stitch, insert the needle from right to left under both strands of the stitch above the one being worked (see sketch no.1), then insert the needle again at the base of the stitch being worked and being it out at the base of the next stitch (see sketch no.2).Use this technique to embroider the number of stitches indicated.After the last stitch, bring the needle out at the base of the row above.Turn the work to start again from right to left.Sketch no 1 Sketch no 2When the border is finished, work a few rows of stocking stitch using a contrasting yarn.
Take the work off the needle and press the stocking stitch section with a warm iron under a damp cloth to prevent it from unraveling. Pin the border to the finished garment, matching the stitches.Unravel all but the last row of stocking stitch.Now graft the stitches, waving the tapestry needle in and out, and unravel the last row of stocking stitch as you go.Bring the needle from back to front through the centre of the second stitch, work a back stitch into the first stitch and bring the needle out again at the centre of the third stitch; now work a backstitch again into the second stitch and continue thus with backstitching as far as the last stitch.Grafting a border Chainstitch shoulder seam CHAINSTITCH SHOULDER SEAMS or 3 needles cast off or 3 needles bind off Leave the remaining shoulder stitches on a spare needles.Place back and front with wrong sides together.
Using a third needle, knit together the first stitch from the front needle with the first from the back needle, and repeat with the second stitch from each needle. You now have 2 stitches on the right-hand needle.Pass the first stitch over the second, as in casting off.Continue thus until you have cast off all the shoulder stitches.The result is a chain that shows on the right side and a shoulder seam that will not go out of shape.To obtain an invisible seam on the right side, place back and front with right sides together.21| TIPS AND HINTS | READ THE INSTRUCTIONS Before you start knitting we advise you to read through the instructions, trying to imagine all of the steps you will be taking.All patterns are well detailed.The instructions are given for several sizes.We suggest that you circle or underline the numbers that correspond to the size you intend to make.If there’s only one number, it applies to all the sizes.
TO OBTAIN A NEAT EDGE, always pull the yarn a little tighter when working the 1st stitch, the stitches at the edge have a tendency to relax. On a sweater this stitch will be hidden in the seam.TO WORK 2 YARNS TOGETHER, prepare a single ball in advance by winding together the yarns required.You will get a more even thread so a better tension and your balls will then not get tangled.If you are using different coloured yarns you will also get a more regular mottled appearance.TO MAKE A TASSEL, cut a piece of cardboard ¾ in (2 cm) longer than the intended tassel.Place a double strand of yarn widthways across the top of the cardboard.Now wind the yarn lengthways 20 to 40 times around the cardboard, depending on the size of the tassel you require.
Tie the double strand of yarn firmly around the yarn loops, then insert scissors between the cardboard and the other end of the yarn loops, and cut through the loops.Wind a length of yarn about ½ in (1 cm) from the tied-off end of the tassel, tie firmly and hide the ends on the inside of the tassel. Finish off by trimming the ends even..TO PICK UP A LOST STITCH, use a crochet hook.When using Stocking St find the position of the lost stitch.Pass the hook through the lost stitch and hook over the following horizontal band.Repeat this step until you can replace the stitch on the left needle to work as normal.TO AVOID DIFFERENCES IN SHADES, never start a jumper without all of the wool.Each dye lot will produce slightly different shades.If you run out of yarn, you can order more by using the dye lot number on the label.TO REMOVE PILLING, which can occur on acrylic yarn, do not pull, but cut off using a pair of small scissors or a pilling razor.
TO MAKE A CORD, cut a strand of yarn at least 5 times the length of the cord required. Fold in half and knot the 2 ends together.Hook the knotted end to a fixed point, a door handle for example.Slip a needle into the loop at the other end.Twist the needle so that the yarn twists Then let the twisted yarn twist back onto itself at the half way point.Detach the end of the cord from the fixed point, tie ends tightly and leave to twist in on itself.TO MAKE A FRINGE, cut a piece of cardboard ¾ in (2 cm) longer than the intended fringe.Wind the yarn around the cardboard, then slip scissors between the yarn and the cardboard and cut through the base of the loops.This will ensure that the strands are all the same length.Insert the crochet hook from wrong side to right side through the first stitch of the knitted edge.Fold a hank of 2 or 3 strands in half and place them over the hook, then pull from the wrong side through the stitch to form a loop.
Pass the remaining ends of the yarn through the loop and pull firmly. Form the rest of the fringe in the same way, spacing the knots 1 to 3 stitches apart, trim the ends even.22 Insert the hook into a stitch, yo and draw up loop, yo and through both loops on hook.Yo twice, insert the hook into a stitch, yo and draw up loop, yo and through first 2 loops on hook, yo and through 2 loops on hook, yo and through remaining 2 loops.Yo, insert the hook into a st, yo and draw up loop, yo and through first 2 loops on hook, yo and through remaining 2 loops.Front (right side [rs]) Back (wrong side [ws]) Beg at left edge: * insert hook into a stitch, yo and draw up lp, yo and through both lps on hook *, rep from * to *, inserting hook into proceeding st..Chain stitch (ch or ch st) Treble (UK: Double Treble) = tr (uk: dbl tr)Double Crochet (UK: Treble) = dc (uk: tr) Half Double Crochet (UK: Half Treble) = hdc (uk: half tr) Stitch (sl st)The first stitch in crochet.Make a loop.

Approx. Approx.Approx.Approx.30| CARING FOR YOUR CREATIONS | 30 Your wool is machine washable at up to 30° on the special «wool» cycle.Preferably use a gentle detergent for woollen items, do not add softener and do not overload the drum to ensure that your woollen items retain their full bulk and softness.Your delicate woollens must only be washed by hand.Use warm water.Wash gently without rubbing or pressing and rinse several times.Never soak, otherwise vivid colours may bleed onto the lighter colours.It is best to use the drum to spin your woollen items.This prevents the fibre from breaking or getting deformed.(up to 2 minutes at 500 revolutions/min).It is strongly recommended that you do not use bleach or stain remover.They could damage the wool.We recommend drying your woollen items flat and sheltered from the sun so they will retain their shape.Some wools have been specially treated so they can be dried in a clothes dryer.We recommend setting it to a moderate temperature.
We recommend using an iron set to very low. Hold it 1 or 2 cm above your woollen items without touching them and only use the steam.Leave to dry in this position so your woollen items retain their shape.We strongly advise you not to iron or steam iron your woollen items.You can give your woollen items to a professional dry cleaner.We strongly advise you not to have your woollen items dry-cleaned.31 0 8 18 4 12 22 2 10 20 6 16 14 24 26 1 9 19 5 13 23 3 11 21 7 17 15 25 Éditeur : Bergère de France - 91 rue Ernest Bradfer 55000 Bar-le-Duc | THE MEASUREMENTS | Take your measurements against those shown in the chart below.Follow the size that matches your measurement.If you fall between 2 sizes choose the larger size.
